## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

During the hiding the stop button and having it come back when you pressed stop was a bit difficult for me and I am not sure. I was following the directions and then I missed that portion of it and I was confused on how to do that, but I came over it by just re-reading the directions and slowing down. I was so worried that I had missed a whole section or something in the instructions because my button wasnt working properly. Also, getting the actual game to play other clues? I am not sure if I am impatient but it seems like the rest of the buttons won't play. I made sure to follow the instructions thoroughly when I rechecked my work so I am not sure. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I think I would like to learn more about how sounds work when it comes to HTML web pages. I was looking at the Sound Synthsizer portion and reading over the code and it doesnt quite make sense to me but I think it will with more research. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would take the time to add a timer and figure out how to fix my sound on the other two buttons I added to the game. I was having a bit of trouble trying to change the freq map function in the script.js.  I really liked this project so if I get into the program hopefully I can do more projects like this. Maybe I will go back and do some more editing on my own time.
